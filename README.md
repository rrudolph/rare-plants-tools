# rare-plants-tools
Rare plants database tools for rare plant work on the California Channel Islands.

`build fields from excel.py` script takes a spreadsheet as input to build fields into a new featureclass.  The spreadsheet is not included in this repo and will need to be acquired separately by contacting the ICBC database team.


`prepare fields for new schema.py` prepares the existing CHIS rare plant database schema to accept the new schema generated by the above script. Once prepared, it needs to be manually appended to the new featureclass.


Four fields need to be manually linked when appending due to the 31 character name cut off during the alter field function.

 ['Representative_soil_texture_note - Representative_soil_texture_not',
  'Representative_surface_cover_note - Representative_surface_cover_no',
  'Herbarium_voucher_collector_number - Herbarium_voucher_collector_num',
  'Herbarium_voucher_catalog_number - Herbarium_voucher_catalog_numbe']


  `RarePlants_Tools.atbx` is posted for general use, it contains a script that backs up, zips, and downloads an AGOL feature service.
